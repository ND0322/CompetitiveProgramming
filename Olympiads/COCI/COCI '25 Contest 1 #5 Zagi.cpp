/*
sub 2
try both ways 

do an rle if needed

sub 3 range dp

notice that for some range, only the intervals at the ends can be different

1 2 3 2 2 2 3 1 3 2

And we wanted to transition 3 for some range
we can take a range aggregate of the insides and manually compute the two ends



sub 4 is do the rle
bsearch to get query parameters
count number of 1s/2s in range


calculate answer for gaps between 2 numbers
fix a number k
and calculate answers between all occurences of k
